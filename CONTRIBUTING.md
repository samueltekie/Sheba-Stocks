## 👥 Team Workflow

We follow a standard GitHub team workflow:

- Main branches:
  - `main` → stable production code
  - `dev` → active development
- Feature branches:
  - `feature/<feature-name>` → for specific features
  - `bugfix/<bug-name>` → for fixing issues

Example:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/kyc-verification
```
